A project for the HackXX 2018, also found on: https://devpost.com/software/any-a.

This project won the HackXX Grand Prize for creating an math education application to empower girls in elementary school, by allowing them to PEMDAS math concepts and to see female role models in math.

## Inspiration
One of our teammates, Nicole, attended an elementary school where girls were notably good at science but often discouraged from pursuing fields in math. Throughout her life and through her story, we believed that intuitively, if women are capable of making progress in science, then women can find a future in math as well, and should not be hindered at an early age.

## What it does
any-a empowers girls in elementary school by helping them practice math and having an early exposure to female role models in math and their accomplishments.

## How we built it
We created a Java app that lets elementary schoolers practice basic math problems with a random math problem generator. We used html and css to link the java app for it to be downloaded through our project website.

## Challenges we ran into
Turning the .java files into a .exe

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Making a first project webpage
- Making something impactful that works as a viable product for our first hackathon for consumers
- Collaboration and discussing all of our needs so that we know what to do quickly to help each other as a team

## What we learned
- How to use git and GitHub
- Team collaboration (both in-person and distance-collaboration through phone)
- Projects take a lot of communications
- Converting all .class files from java to .jar
- Make buttons, textfields, and images appear on html, css, and java applet

## What's next for ANY-A
Create a tutorial page at the beginning of the program, as well as a welcome page
Create a log-in system to input a username and password
Enable encryption system for password
Improve efficiency in framework
